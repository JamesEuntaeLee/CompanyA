NOTE:
firebase-install is separate to the main project, but would be how the admin injects raw data.
The raw spreadsheet is fed through Co-pilot, giving the json files mentioned in importData.js.
After downloading the json files and verifying the names, execute the following in cmd prompt:
cd firebase-import
npm install firebase-admin
node importData.js
The data will then be in their assigned firestore collections.
